# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project aims to develop a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using machine learning to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on past transaction data. By focusing on patterns in transaction **amounts** and **timing**, the system can help financial institutions flag suspicious activities and prevent fraudulent transactions.

## Introduction

Credit card fraud occurs when someone uses another person's card information to make unauthorized purchases. The **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** aims to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in transaction data, especially focusing on the **Amount** and **Time** of the transactions. Using this model, we aim to detect 100% of fraudulent transactions while minimizing incorrect fraud classifications.

## Intuitions

### 1. **Transaction Amounts in Different Classes**
   - **Legitimate Transactions**: Often follow typical spending patterns (e.g., groceries, bills).
   - **Fraudulent Transactions**: Tend to be either very high (to exploit the card) or very low (to test the card’s validity).
   
   **Insight**: Large deviations in transaction amounts from the cardholder’s usual behavior can be an indicator of fraud.

### 2. **Transaction Timing**
   - Fraudulent transactions may be more frequent during off-hours (late nights, early mornings) when the cardholder is less likely to notice suspicious activity.
   
   **Insight**: Transactions made during unusual times can be flagged for further review.

## Challenges

### 1. **Defining "Fraud"**
   - Fraud can be difficult to define universally, and different businesses may have different definitions based on their risk tolerance.
   
### 2. **Imbalanced Dataset**
   - Fraudulent transactions make up less than 1% of the total data, leading to an imbalanced dataset, which poses challenges in training machine learning models.

### 3. **Optimizing for Imbalanced Data**
   - We need to balance maximizing fraud detection (recall) while minimizing the false positive rate (FPR).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Imbalanced-learn**: Handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jayanth-007/credit-card-fraud-detection-system.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To explore the step-by-step analysis, run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fraud_Detection.ipynb
   ```

2. For standalone execution:

   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used can be found at [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It consists of:

- **V1-V28**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformed features.
- **Time**: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: 1 indicates fraud, 0 indicates non-fraud.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: True positive rate for fraud detection.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual frauds detected.
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between fraud and non-fraud.

## Business Questions

1. **How different is the amount of money used in different transaction classes?**
   - Fraudulent transactions often involve unusual amounts (very high or very low).

2. **Do fraudulent transactions occur more often during certain time frames?**
   - Fraud is more frequent during off-peak hours, such as late at night or early morning.
